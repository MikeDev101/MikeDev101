## The Quack Attack Strikes Back!

I'm MikeDEV!

I'm a college freshman (Class of 2026) who enjoys computer programming and electrical engineering. I like ducks, I enjoy dark and cursed humor, I am more or less an otaku, and I also have a tendency to self-destruct when I get very tenacious with projects. I also enjoy vintage computing and old arcade machines.

I program mainly in Python, a little bit of Javascript and a little in HTML. I'm a former Scratcher, with my history in Scratch dating all the way back to 2015.

I own and manage the Meower Media Co. Organization/Collaboration, which was started originally on Scratch, but I moved it to Github to keep the Scratch Team from murdering it in cold blood. (duck you, ST. :D ðŸ–•)

### Some of my favorite projects
1. [Snakeware](https://github.com/joshiemoore/snakeware) - This is a complete Linux Distro designed to run only Python! It's a bit slow and some functionality is left to be desired, but it's really cool!
2. [BubbleDrive8](https://github.com/ika-musume/BubbleDrive8) - A Bubble Software cartridge emulator for the Konami Bubble System (my favorite arcade machine)!
3. [stm-bmc](https://github.com/evilwombat/stm-bmc) - A Bubble Memory controller made using modern electronics!
