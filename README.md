# 🛠️ Projects
## Current

### 🌐 [CloudLink Omega](https://github.com/cloudlink-omega)
Cloudlink Omega is a WebRTC-powered 

## Archived
[@Voxalice](https://github.com/Voxalice/) hosts an archive of a bunch of my old Scratch projects. [You can check out the archive here.](https://github.com/Voxalice/MikeDEV-Archive/tree/main)

### 🌐 [CloudLink](https://github.com/MikeDev101/cloudlink)
Cloudlink was my first major project. In short, it is a websocket protocol designed for use with Scratch 3.0 modded IDEs. The original backend is written in Python, and the client is written using Javascript as a Scratch 3.0 extension. When I joined Meower, it also became a major part of Meower's history.

### 🐈 [Meower](https://github.com/meower-media-co/)
Meower is a free and open-source social media platform that respects your privacy.

I was Meower's second owner and served as a system administrator, US East server host, backend developer and moderator for several years. I decided to leave the project on August 9th, 2024. If you're looking for a platform that respects you as a Human and upholds your privacy rights, I highly suggest you check them out!

I was also responsible for making the first Meower client, [Meower-Vanilla](https://github.com/meower-media-co/Meower-Vanilla). 

# Github Shoutouts
1. [Snakeware](https://github.com/joshiemoore/snakeware) - This is a complete Linux Distro designed to run only Python! It's a bit slow and some functionality is left to be desired, but it's really cool!
2. [BubbleDrive8](https://github.com/ika-musume/BubbleDrive8) - A Bubble Software cartridge emulator for the Konami Bubble System (my favorite arcade machine)!
3. [stm-bmc](https://github.com/evilwombat/stm-bmc) - A Bubble Memory controller made using modern electronics!
