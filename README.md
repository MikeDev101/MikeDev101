## The Quack Attack Strikes Back!

I'm MikeDEV!

I'm a highschool senior (Class of 2022) who enjoys computer programming and electrical engineering. I like ducks, I enjoy dark and cursed humor, I am more or less an otaku, and I also have a tendency to self-destruct when I get very tenacious with projects. I also enjoy vintage computing and old arcade machines.

I program mainly in Python, a little bit of Javascript and a little in HTML. I'm a former Scratcher, with my history in Scratch dating all the way back to 2015.

I own and manage the Meower Media Co. Organization/Collaboration, which was started originally on Scratch, but I moved it to Github to keep the Scratch Team from murdering it in cold blood. (duck you, ST. :D ðŸ–•)

### Some of my favorite projects
1. [Snakeware](https://github.com/joshiemoore/snakeware) - This is a complete Linux Distro designed to run only Python! It's a bit slow and some functionality is left to be desired, but it's really cool!
2. [BubbleDrive8](https://github.com/ika-musume/BubbleDrive8) - A Bubble Software cartridge emulator for the Konami Bubble System (my favorite arcade machine)!
3. [stm-bmc](https://github.com/evilwombat/stm-bmc) - A Bubble Memory controller made using modern electronics!

### Projects I own/am a part of
1. [Meower](https://github.com/meower-media-co/) - A free, open-source, and nonprofit Social Media Platform, with it's origins from Scratch.
2. [CloudLink](https://github.com/MikeDev101/cloudlink) - A powerful websocket client/server solution. Server written in Python, clients written in JS. Originally created for Scratch 3.0 mods.
3. [Polaris](https://github.com/JTechnologies/Polaris) - A new community for Scratch.
4. [osu!js](https://github.com/TheEggo58/osujs-master) - An osu! client written in Scratch 3.0.

### Other historical/legacy projects
1. CatChat - A club-penguin inspired game made using Scratch. (Looking into reviving this project)
2. Cherry OS - My own take on a Scratch-powered Operating System. (dead?)
3. ZestX - An interpreted programming language written in Scratch 2.0. If Ruby, Python, and C/C++ had a child, it would be ZestX. (dead!)
4. ZestOS - Another pen-based OS written with ZestX, in Scratch 2.0. (dead!)
5. Linux NEO Kernel - A Scratch 2.0 Kernel. (dead!)
6. NX Kernel - Another Scratch 2.0 Kernel. (dead!)
7. ToonTown Online 2D - Recreating ToonTown Online using Scratch 3.0 and CloudLink. (dead!)
