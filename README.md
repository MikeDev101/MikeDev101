# Projects
## Current
### [Meower](https://github.com/meower-media-co/)
Meower is a nonprofit, free and open-source social media platform with humor, friendliness, and privacy in mind. Our ultimate goal is to create a place that's ethical for it's users and convenient to use. 

My primary role in Meower is to function as it's Chief Executive Officer. I also take care of content moderation, backend development, cybersecurity, infrastructure maintenance, and systems administration. I used to be a frontend developer, I made possible the original Meower client: [Meower-Vanilla](https://github.com/meower-media-co/Meower-Vanilla). I've retired as a Scratch programmer, and this client is retiring as well.

### [CloudLink](https://github.com/MikeDev101/cloudlink)
Cloudlink was my first major project. In short, it is a websocket protocol designed for use with Scratch 3.0 modded IDEs. The original backend is written in Python, and the client is written using Javascript as a Scratch 3.0 extension. When I joined Meower, it also became a major part of Meower's history.
